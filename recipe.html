        <li>3 Tablespoons or to Taste-<br>Extra Vergin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Two to Tree Shrimp per Person-<br>Organic Frozen Shrimp</li>

        <li>Four to Six Leaves-Basil </li>
        <li>Several Peices-Cilantro <br>(Not Required for Recipe)</li>
        <li>Salt-to taste</li>
        <li>1/8 to 2/8 cup Reccomended-Butter</li>
        <li>A medium to large sized<br> metal pot</li>
        <li>Enough water to fill the pot 2/3 of the way</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>So, what you're going to do is simple and will take little effort. Here are the simple steps:</p>
        <li>First, fill up the pot with water and boil it on <strong>low heat.</strong> </li>
        <li>Next, what you're going to do is defrost two of the frozen shrimps by putting them on the counter-<strong>still</strong> incased <em>in the bag</em>-Two per person.</li>
        <li>While the Shrimp is defrosting and the water is boiling, prep the noodles by pulling them out of the bag, and cutting them in half.</li>
        <li> Then place them in the boiling water simmering on <strong>low heat</strong>.</li>
        <li>Once you do that, the shrimp should be done defrosting. If they are cool to the touch, then reheat them. </li>
        <li>When the pasta is complete cooking, then strain it and put it to the side.</li>
        <li>Put the butter and olive oil in the pan and heat until the butter is melted and the solution, <em>(which we will call 'boliv oil')</em> is warm.</li>
        <li><strong>Wash</strong> cilantro and cut it.</li>
        <li>Put the pasta in a large serving bowl, and mix in the <strong><em>Boliv oil</em></strong>, then add the salt and lemon pepper to taste. </li>
        <li>Next put the shrimp on top with the cilantro, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>(Serves best warm).</p>
